# Learnings - 2026-04-15

## Meta: AI Collaboration Process Learnings

Distilled from the mistakes captured in the sessions below. These are the process rules we keep relearning — codified here so future sessions don't repeat them. The enforceable versions now live in `CLAUDE.md` §6 and §8.

### Trust-But-Verify is Not Optional

- **Commit messages are not evidence.** PR #11 session had a commit titled "fix: call onSubmit on offline queue and wrap in try/catch" that did NOT actually apply the `catch (err: unknown)` TypeScript fix. Assumption cost real hours.
  - **Rule:** After any subagent run or `/compact` boundary, re-read the actual files before trusting progress.
- **Subagent summaries describe intent, not result.** Summaries say what the agent tried to do, not what landed in git.
  - **Rule:** Always diff-inspect after subagent dispatch; never just accept the summary.
- **Tests passing ≠ the change is correct.** Fragile mocks can pass without exercising the new code (see RAF mock drift issues).
  - **Rule:** For new behavior, write the failing test, run it, observe red with a meaningful error, THEN implement.

### Scope Discipline Prevents Silent Disasters

- **One concern per conversation.** Bundling "fix X and also Y and refactor Z" produces muddled diffs and failed two-stage review.
- **Branch isolation failures are recurring.** Subagent on `main` commits to `main`, not the feature branch, if you don't `cd` into the worktree first. Always verify `git branch -vv` before dispatch.
- **Feature freezes for structural changes are mandatory.** The planned folder restructure (Plan 8 of the migration) MUST happen without concurrent feature work on the same files.

### Risky-Change Discipline

- **Firestore rules, DB indexes, Cloud Function deploys, and auth flow changes** all have blast radius large enough that a 30-second manual diff review is cheaper than a 4-hour rollback.
- **Never deploy to prod in the same session the change was authored.** Overnight soak in staging catches issues the dev loop doesn't.
- **Rollback command goes in the PR description** — known in advance, not improvised under pressure.

### Mock Fragility is a Code Smell

- When a unit test needs 50+ lines of mock setup (firebase, navigator, RAF, crypto, clipboard), the test may be asserting only that the mocks return what we configured. Budget ~20 lines of mock before considering an integration test with emulators.
- `vi.hoisted` is the workaround for Vitest's mock-factory hoisting, not a pattern to prefer. Use when needed; don't spread unnecessarily.

### Communication Principles

- **Uncertainty is information.** "I'm not sure — here's what I'd verify" is more useful than a confident wrong answer.
- **Sycophancy is a bug.** When user instructions conflict with CLAUDE.md (YAGNI, `any`, etc.), surface the conflict instead of complying silently.
- **Short answers for simple questions.** No headers/sections/insights blocks when a sentence suffices.

## Task 11: Query/Schema Mismatch Caught by Code Review

**Session:** Task 11 (Firestore Indexes) code quality review.

**Issue:** Implementer changed dispatch read queries from `assignedTo` to `responderId`, but `ReportOps` interface only had `assignedTo` — no `responderId` field. Additionally, `updateResponderStatus` wrote only `responderStatus`, not `status`, so new dispatches would never match the new `status`-based query filter.

**Caught by:** Code quality reviewer subagent identified:
1. `ReportOps` type missing `responderId` and `status` fields
2. `updateResponderStatus` write path didn't populate normalized `status` field
3. New dispatches would silently not appear in dispatch list queries

**Fix applied:**
- Added `responderId?: string` and `status?: string` to `ReportOps` interface
- `updateResponderStatus` now writes BOTH legacy (`responderStatus`) and normalized (`status`, `responderId`) fields
- Reads use normalized fields; writes are dual-field for migration compatibility

**Key insight:** When normalizing a schema field, you must update BOTH the read path AND the write path. A query that reads `status` will return zero documents if `updateResponderStatus` only writes `responderStatus`. The index was correctly added, but the data flow was incomplete without the type fix and write-path fix.

## Simplify Review: Firestore Rules Task 10 Fixes

**Session:** Post-PR-review simplify phase on Task 10 (Firestore Rules responder dispatch hardening).

### Issues Fixed

**1. Dead `opsId` argument in `isResponderOwner(opsId)` calls (firestore.rules:148, 160):**
`isResponderOwner()` function takes zero parameters. Both `report_ops` read and update rules were calling `isResponderOwner(opsId)` passing `opsId`, which Firestore Rules silently ignores. Fixed by removing the argument on both call sites: `isResponderOwner()`.

**2. SOS events test cleanup ID mismatch (firestore.rules.test.ts:58-79):**
`afterEach` cleanup used `reportId` (auto-generated) as the document ID for `sos_events` deletion, but SOS tests use fixed string IDs (`test-sos-event`, `test-sos-create`, `test-sos-other`, `test-sos-admin-read`). This caused silent cleanup failures for all SOS events. Fixed by adding explicit `sosEventIds` array with known string IDs and deleting them before the report loop.

### Key Insight: Firestore Rules Function Arguments

In Firestore Rules DSL, function parameters are silently discarded if the function doesn't reference them. `isResponderOwner(opsId)` compiles and runs fine — `opsId` is just ignored. This is a security code smell: misleading function call syntax implies the parameter is used. Always match call sites to actual function signatures.

## PR Review Fixes: useSOS + SOSButton

**Session:** Fixed 11 issues found in PR #20 review (Task 9 — SOSButton).

### Critical Fixes

**1. Silent GPS watch failure (useSOS.ts:74-76):**
GPS `watchPosition` error callback only logged to console — UI still showed "Live GPS: Sharing" while tracking was dead. Fixed by adding `gpsError` state and setting `locationSharing = false` on error.

**2. Catch-all NETWORK_ERROR masking real error types (useSOS.ts:221-225, 305-311):**
String-matching error messages (`message.includes('already active')`) is fragile — breaks if SDK message changes. Fixed by checking `err.code` (Firestore structured error code) first: `permission-denied`, `already-exists`, `not-found`, `deadline-exceeded`, `unavailable`.

**3. No retry on transient Firestore errors:**
Emergency SOS/cancel operations failed with no recovery path for `deadline-exceeded` or `unavailable`. Fixed by adding 1 retry with 1s backoff delay for transient errors. Non-retryable errors (`ALREADY_ACTIVE`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `SOS_NOT_FOUND`) fail immediately.

**4. window.confirm silent failure (SOSButton.tsx:91):**
When browser blocked `window.confirm` or user dismissed it, nothing happened — no feedback. Fixed by adding `alert()` call when confirm returns false: "SOS cancellation kept. Your emergency signal remains active."

### Minor Fixes

- **Error IDs for Sentry:** Added `crypto.randomUUID()` (with `Date.now().toString(36)` fallback) to all `[SOS_ERROR]` console logs for error correlation
- **Unused `callbacks` array:** Removed dead code in RAF mock (SOSButton.test.tsx:50)
- **Keyboard activation tests:** Added tests for Enter/Space immediate `activateSOS()` call
- **Unmount cleanup test:** Added test verifying RAF cancellation on unmount during hold

### Key Insight: Error Code vs String Matching

Firestore errors have stable, structured `err.code` strings (`permission-denied`, `deadline-exceeded`). String-matching `err.message` breaks when messages change or are localized. Always check `err.code` first, then fall back to string matching only when needed.

## Testing requestAnimationFrame in Vitest

**Issue:** `vi.useFakeTimers()` does not reliably auto-spy `requestAnimationFrame` in jsdom environment in Vitest 3. Tests using `vi.advanceTimersByTime(3000)` inside `act()` failed because RAF callbacks were not being flushed.

**Fix:** Explicitly mock `requestAnimationFrame` using `vi.hoisted()` to capture the callback reference, then invoke it directly in tests:

```typescript
const savedRAFCallback = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  current: ((_cb: FrameRequestCallback): number => 0) as ((cb: FrameRequestCallback) => number) | null,
}))

vi.stubGlobal('requestAnimationFrame', (cb: FrameRequestCallback): number => {
  savedRAFCallback.current = cb
  return ++id
})

// In test:
const cb = savedRAFCallback.current
if (cb) cb(performance.now())  // advance time
```

This pattern guarantees the tick runs synchronously in tests without relying on Vitest's auto-spy RAF behavior, which is unreliable in jsdom.

# Learnings - 2026-04-14

## QA Edge Case Scan Findings

**Session:** Dispatched 5 parallel qa-edge-hunter agents covering security, input validation, concurrency, error handling, and performance.

**Report saved to:** `docs/qa-findings/edge-case-report-2026-04-14.md`

### Critical Findings by Category

| Category         | Critical Issues                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auth/AuthZ       | MFA dead code (lockout); municipality filter ignored; no rate limiting on Cloud Functions |
| Data Integrity   | Non-atomic 3-tier writes; timeline read-modify-write race                                 |
| Input Validation | GPS 0,0 accepted; out-of-range coords accepted; photo size not validated                  |
| Error Handling   | Photo failure silent; auto-sync failure silent; queue service failure silent              |
| Concurrency      | TOCTOU duplicate bypass; timeline race; IndexedDB init race                               |
| Performance      | Unbounded IndexedDB; N+1 deletes; feed pagination using page numbers not cursors          |
| Security         | MFA lockout; cross-municipality leakage; path traversal risk                              |

### Top Architectural Issues

1. **`getMunicipalityReports` ignores municipality parameter** — cross-municipality data leakage
2. **3-tier write non-atomic** — partial state on network failure
3. **All MFA methods throw "not implemented"** — provincial admins locked out
4. **Silent failures throughout** — disaster system where silent failures are deadly

### Key Insight for Disaster System

For a disaster mapping system used during actual emergencies:

- Silent failures = potential loss of life
- Non-atomic writes = corrupted data when infrastructure is unstable
- Cross-municipality leakage = privacy breach at scale
- Unbounded queues = system collapse during mass events

All P0/P1 issues must be fixed before production deployment.

## ReportForm Submit Button Not Working — Missing Geolocation Hook

**Issue:** Report form's submit button appeared to do nothing. Form was stuck at "Detecting location…" forever, preventing submission.

**Root Cause:** `ReportForm` accepts `userLocation` and `gpsError` as optional props but does NOT call `useGeolocation()` internally. In `routes.tsx`, it's rendered with no location props: `<ReportForm onSubmit={...} />`. Since neither GPS nor error state was available, the form showed "Detecting location…" indefinitely with no way to proceed.

**Key insight:** When a component depends on external data (geolocation), it should either:

1. Fetch it internally (resilient — works regardless of parent), OR
2. Make it a required prop (explicit — parent MUST provide it, caught at compile time)

Optional props for critical data = silent failure.

**Fix:** Added `useGeolocation()` call inside ReportForm. Props override hook values for backward compatibility and tests:

```typescript
const geo = useGeolocation()
const resolvedUserLocation = userLocation ?? geo.coordinates ?? undefined
const resolvedGpsError = gpsError ?? (geo.loading ? undefined : (geo.error ?? undefined))
```

This ensures:

- During loading: shows "Detecting location…"
- On GPS success: shows coordinates, enables GPS-based submission
- On GPS error (permission denied, etc.): shows manual municipality/barangay dropdowns

**Test impact:** Added `useGeolocation` mock (with `vi.hoisted`) to both ReportForm test files. All 37 existing tests pass unchanged because they provide explicit `userLocation`/`gpsError` props that override the hook.

# Learnings - 2026-04-13

## Auto-Sync Error Handling Test Gap

**Issue:** Spec review found that the auto-sync error test only asserted `syncResult.failed === 1`, not that `console.error` was called with `[AUTO_SYNC_ERROR]` tag. The `.catch()` handler in auto-sync useEffect was never verified.

**Root Cause:** `syncQueue` is designed to never reject - it catches all errors internally and returns `{ success, failed }`. The `.catch()` in auto-sync (lines 222-225) was unreachable with the original implementation.

**Fix Applied:**

1. Added defensive check in `syncQueue` that throws if `reportQueueService` is unavailable (infrastructure failure)
2. Updated test to trigger auto-sync useEffect by toggling `isOnline` from false to true
3. Mocked `updateMock` to reject, which causes `update(failedReport)` in the catch block to fail
4. Verified `console.error` is called with `[AUTO_SYNC_ERROR]` and the error message

**Key Insight:** The error at `reportQueueService.update(failedReport)` (line 207) is OUTSIDE any try/catch - it's in the catch block itself. If this update fails, the entire `syncQueue` function rejects, triggering the auto-sync `.catch()` handler.

```typescript
// The try/catch handles errors during sync
try {
  await reportQueueService.update(syncingReport)
  // ... sync logic
} catch (error) {
  // This update is NOT wrapped in try/catch
  // If it fails, syncQueue rejects and auto-sync .catch() handles it
  await reportQueueService.update(failedReport)
}
```

## Development Process

### Subagent-Driven Development Notes

**What worked well:**

- Two-stage review (spec compliance → code quality) caught real issues:
  - Untyped `catch (err)` in LinkReportsByPhone
  - `window.location.href` SPA routing anti-pattern
  - Missing `aria-hidden` on decorative icons
- Fresh subagent per task kept context clean
- Implementer → spec reviewer → code reviewer flow ensured quality gates

**What to avoid:**

- Don't skip review loops when issues are found
- Don't move to next task while either review has open issues

### Code Quality Patterns

**TypeScript Strict Mode:**

- `catch (err)` without type annotation violates strict mode → use `catch (err: unknown)`
- React Router navigation: Use `useNavigate()` hook, not `window.location.href`
- Decorative icons need `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility

**React Hooks:**

- Always mock `react-router-dom` when testing components that use `useNavigate`

**Firestore in Tests:**

- Firebase emulators needed for E2E tests - unit tests mock the SDK
- Offline queue tests have infrastructure incompatibility (Playwright's `setOffline()` doesn't trigger `navigator.onLine`)

### Architecture Decisions

**Anonymous Report Linking:**

- Phone-based linking queries `report_private` collection by `reporterPhone`
- Validation uses PH mobile regex: `/^(\+?63|0)?[0-9]{10}$/`

**COPPA Age Gate:**

- Uses localStorage key `age_verified` for persistence
- Renders null when already verified (checks on mount)

**Rate Limiting UI:**

- Hardcoded `mdrmoHotline` and `retryAfterMinutes` - consider making configurable

**ReportDetailScreen + Timeline:**

- Timeline built from report status history (submitted, verified, resolved)
- Share button uses native share API with clipboard fallback

**BeforeAfterGallery:**

- Uses URL as key for photo items - fragile for duplicate URLs
- Fullscreen viewer supports prev/next navigation

## Mistakes Made

1. **Task 13 (LinkReportsByPhone):** Initially used `window.location.href` which breaks SPA routing - fixed via code review
2. **Task 13:** Untyped catch parameter - fixed via code review
3. **Task 15 (RateLimitExceeded):** Decorative icons missing `aria-hidden` - fixed before amend
4. **E2E Tests:** Offline queue tests have infrastructure issue (navigator.onLine vs socket-level offline) - documented as known limitation

## Context for Future Sessions

- This session implemented Tasks 1-17 from `citizen-features-gap-fix.md` plan
- Tasks 1-10 were completed before context compaction
- Tasks 11-17 completed in this session with full two-stage review
- Pre-compaction state preserved in vault for context continuity

# Learnings - 2026-04-12

## Firebase Test Mocks Pattern

**Issue:** `ReportForm.test.tsx` failed with `FirebaseError: auth/invalid-api-key` because it imports `useDuplicateCheck` which transitively imports `firebase/firestore`, triggering firebase auth initialization before mocks are applied.

**Fix:** Added firebase mocks to `ReportForm.test.tsx`:

```typescript
vi.mock('firebase/firestore', () => ({
  collection: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({}),
  query: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({}),
  where: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({}),
  orderBy: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({}),
  limit: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({}),
  getDocs: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ docs: [], forEach: () => {} }),
  Timestamp: { fromDate: vi.fn((date: Date) => ({ toDate: () => date })) },
}))

vi.mock('firebase/auth', () => ({
  onAuthStateChanged: vi.fn((auth, callback) => {
    callback(null)
    return vi.fn()
  }),
  signInWithEmailAndPassword: vi.fn(),
  signOut: vi.fn(),
}))

vi.mock('@/app/firebase/config', () => ({
  db: {},
  auth: {
    onAuthStateChanged: vi.fn((callback) => {
      callback(null)
      return vi.fn()
    }),
  },
}))
```

Also needed `vi.hoisted` mock state reset in `beforeEach`:

```typescript
duplicateCheckState.duplicates = [] // reset shared mock state
```

## Error Handling Patterns

1. **File access errors:** Wrap `e.target.files` access in try/catch — `SecurityError`, `NotAllowedError`, `AbortError` can occur on file selection
2. **Callback errors:** Wrap `onSubmit?.()` calls in try/catch — parent callbacks can throw without crashing the form
3. **Offline queue:** Call `onSubmit?.()` before `enqueueReport()` so parent is always notified
4. **`Promise.allSettled`:** Use for multi-file operations where partial success is meaningful

## Pre-existing Issues Found

- `useReportQueue.test.ts` and `QueueIndicator.test.tsx` lack firebase mocks — fail without `.env.local`
- `ReportForm.tsx` has pre-existing TS errors (unused `Button` import, type mismatch in `onSubmit` callback)
- `useReportQueue.ts` has pre-existing TS error at `submitReport` call (type mismatch)

## Learnings - 2026-04-12 (PR #11 Session)

### Subagent Branch Isolation Issue

**Problem:** Implementer subagent's commits for Task 2 (`loadError` surfacing) were made to branch `fix/ui-enhancements-and-pr6-restoration-2026-04-12` instead of `fix/pr10-test-error-fixes-2026-04-12`. Root cause: subagent ran on `main` branch (controller's main worktree) instead of the feature worktree.

**Prevention:** Before dispatching subagents, verify `git branch -vv` shows the correct worktree is being used. When using worktrees, either:

1. `cd` into the worktree directory before dispatching, OR
2. Have subagent use `git -C /path/to/worktree` commands

### Vitest Mock Path Issues in useReportQueue Tests

**Problem:** `vi.mock('../../services/reportQueue.service', ...)` used wrong path. Test file at `hooks/__tests__/` → service at `services/` requires `'../../services/reportQueue.service'`. With `vi.fn()` inside `vi.mock` factory without `vi.hoisted()`, per-test `mockImplementation()` calls have no effect because factory runs once at module init.

**Fix:** Use `vi.hoisted()` to create shared mock function references that are initialized before `vi.mock` runs:

```typescript
const getAllMock = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn().mockResolvedValue([]))
vi.mock('../../services/reportQueue.service', () => ({
  reportQueueService: { getAll: getAllMock, ... }
}))
// Now per-test: getAllMock.mockRejectedValueOnce(...)
```

### Template Literal Escaping in Edit Tool

**Problem:** Using Edit tool with template literal backticks (`` ` ``) sometimes resulted in escaped backticks (`\``) in the file, breaking TypeScript.

**Lesson:** When editing template literals, ensure the new_string contains unescaped backticks. The Edit tool passes strings literally — any escaping in input ends up in the file.

### What Worked

- Two-stage review (spec compliance → code quality) continued to catch real issues
- Test-writing tasks (4-8) proceeded cleanly with no infrastructure issues
- Accepting limitations and documenting them was better than spending excessive time debugging

### Verification Gap — Always Re-Check Before Assuming

**Problem:** After context compaction, I assumed Task 1 (`catch (err: unknown)` in ReportForm) was done because a commit existed (`169bb57 fix(ReportForm): call onSubmit on offline queue and wrap in try/catch`). But the commit used bare `catch (err)` without `unknown` type — the actual TypeScript fix was never applied.

**Lesson:** Just because a commit with a similar message exists doesn't mean the actual fix was implemented. Always verify the actual code state rather than trusting commit messages or summaries.

**What to do:** When resuming after compaction, re-read the actual source files to verify task completion rather than relying on vault summaries or commit messages.

### Vitest Path Resolution in Worktrees

**Issue:** When running `npm run test` from the controller session, it runs tests against `main` branch (at `/home/exxeed/dev/projects/bantayog-alert`), not the worktree. Worktree tests must be run from within the worktree directory.

**Fix:** Always `cd` into the worktree before running tests, or use absolute paths that point into the worktree.

### Bare `catch (err)` Still Violates TypeScript Strict Mode

**Issue:** `catch (err)` without type annotation is technically valid JS but violates TypeScript's `noImplicitAny` in strict mode when the catch clause parameter has no type. Wait — actually `catch (err)` IS valid TypeScript. The `unknown` type is about _which_ type to use, not _whether_ to use a type.

The real issue is that `catch (error)` gives you `any` implicitly in non-strict mode, and the project uses strict mode. So `catch (err: unknown)` is the correct pattern for TypeScript strictness.

## Learnings - 2026-04-12 (PR #12 Error Handling Session)

### Silent Failure Pattern in RegisteredProfile

**Issue:** `handleSyncNow`, `handleLogout`, and `handleDownloadData` all used bare `console.error` in catch blocks without surfacing errors to users.

**Fix applied:** Added error states (`syncError`, `logoutError`, `downloadError`) with user-facing error messages.

### Gap Analysis During Plan Review

Before implementing, we reviewed the plan against actual code and found:

1. **syncResult conflict** - When sync fails, old "Last sync: X synced" message would persist alongside error. Fixed by clearing `syncResult` on error.
2. **logoutError UI location** - Logout button is in main `RegisteredProfile` component, not `SettingsTab`. Error display must be co-located with the button, not passed as prop.
3. **downloadError vs deleteError** - Both errors display in Data Management section (same area), handled by stacking them in a `space-y-2` container.

### Error State Placement Rules

| Error State     | Display Location                            | Why                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `syncError`     | SettingsTab (Pending Reports section)       | Sync is a SettingsTab feature     |
| `logoutError`   | RegisteredProfile main (near logout button) | Logout is NOT in SettingsTab      |
| `downloadError` | SettingsTab (Data Management section)       | Download is a SettingsTab feature |
| `deleteError`   | SettingsTab (Data Management section)       | Delete is a SettingsTab feature   |

### Error Message Patterns

```typescript
// For user-facing errors (surfaced in UI):
setError(error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Fallback message')

// For internal errors (logged only):
console.error('[ERROR_TAG]', error)
```

### vi.hoisted() Pattern for Error Test Mocks

When testing error flows, use `vi.hoisted()` for mock functions so per-test `.mockRejectedValueOnce()` works:

```typescript
const mockSyncQueue = vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ success: 0, failed: 0 }))

vi.mock('@/features/report/hooks/useReportQueue', () => ({
  useReportQueue: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
    syncQueue: mockSyncQueue,
    // ...
  }),
}))

// In test:
mockSyncQueue.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Network error'))
```

### Subagent-Driven Development: Plan Review Phase

Adding a "plan review" phase before dispatching implementers caught 3 real issues:

1. Missing `setSyncResult(null)` on error
2. Wrong component for logout error display
3. Missing logout error test case

**Lesson:** Don't skip gap analysis - read actual code against plan before implementing.

## Learnings - 2026-04-12 (Alerts System — onSnapshot Rewrite)

### vi.hoisted Cannot Reference External const

**Problem:** `vi.hoisted(() => ({ subscribeToAlerts: subscribeToAlertsMock }))` failed with `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'subscribeToAlertsMock' before initialization` because `vi.hoisted` runs before module-level `const` declarations are initialized.

**Fix:** Define all mock functions INSIDE the `vi.hoisted` callback:

```typescript
const { subscribeToAlertsMock, subscribeToAlertsByMunicipalityMock } = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  subscribeToAlertsMock: vi.fn(),
  subscribeToAlertsByMunicipalityMock: vi.fn(),
}))
vi.mock('../../services/alert.service', () => ({
  subscribeToAlerts: subscribeToAlertsMock,
  subscribeToAlertsByMunicipality: subscribeToAlertsByMunicipalityMock,
}))
```

### onSnapshot Tests Need Immediate Mock Setup

**Issue:** When tests call `renderHook` without an immediate `mockImplementation`, the hook's `useEffect` runs synchronously and the mock must be pre-set (via `mockReturnValue` in `beforeEach`) or the test would throw.

**Fix:** Always set `mockReturnValue(vi.fn())` in `beforeEach` for the subscription mocks, then override per-test with `mockImplementation`.

### Dual-snapshot Merge Logic

**Decision:** When both `municipality` AND `role` are provided, both `subscribeToAlerts` (with role filter) and `subscribeToAlertsByMunicipality` run in parallel. Each listener calls `setAlerts` by merging new results with existing state and deduplicating by id. A counter tracks when both have delivered their first snapshot before setting `isLoading = false`.

### useAlerts IndexedDB Cache Fallback

**Implementation:** Added `alertsCache.ts` (new file) with `cacheAlerts()` and `loadCachedAlerts()` using a dedicated `bantayog-alerts-cache` IndexedDB database. On `onSnapshot` error, `handleError` in `useAlerts` becomes `async`, persists the current alert set to cache, then loads the cache as fallback so the UI stays populated instead of going blank.

**Key decision:** Used a separate `useEffect` to sync `useRef` with state (`latestAlertsRef.current = alerts`), rather than passing `alerts` as a `useRef` initializer. This prevents the ref from capturing stale initial state while still avoiding the circular-state-update problem.

**Lesson on ref + state synchronization:** `const ref = useRef(initialState)` initializes the ref once; `ref.current` never updates when `initialState` changes. You need a separate effect that writes `ref.current = state` on every render to keep them in sync.

### UserContext Pattern — No Pre-existing Context Found

**Problem:** Task asked to wire `AlertList` to receive `municipality` and `role` from "user context", but no such context existed in the codebase. `useAuth` only returns Firebase `User` (no `municipality`/`role`).

**Solution:** Created `UserContext.tsx` in `src/shared/hooks/` using the existing Firestore `getDocument` pattern — `useAuth` provides the Firebase UID, Firestore `users/{uid}` provides `municipality` and `role`. Anonymous users get `undefined` for both (fine — `useAlerts` handles missing args gracefully).

### vi.spyOn + Extra Args in Integration Tests

**Problem:** `vi.spyOn(useAlertsModule, 'useAlerts').mockReturnValue(...)` worked but Vitest internals sometimes inject extra args into the mock call. `toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({...}), expect.any(Object), expect.any(Function))` failed because the second and third args were not `Object` and `Function` (they were Vitest internals).

**Fix:** Access `spy.mock.calls[0]?.[0]` to verify only the first argument:

```typescript
expect(spy.mock.calls[0]?.[0]).toMatchObject({ municipality: 'Daet', role: 'citizen' })
```

### Firebase Test Mocks for Integration Tests

When a component uses a context that fetches from Firestore (like `UserContext`), the integration test needs firebase mocks at the module level. Required mocks:

- `vi.mock('@/app/firebase/config')` — bypasses `getAuth`/`getFirestore` app initialization
- `vi.mock('firebase/firestore')` — `getFirestore`, `collection`, `doc`, `getDoc`, `onSnapshot`
- `vi.mock('firebase/auth')` — `getAuth`, `onAuthStateChanged`
- `vi.mock('@/shared/services/firestore.service')` — `getDocument`

Use `vi.hoisted` for mock refs that need per-test reset via `beforeEach`.

### navigator.clipboard Mocking Limitation in Vitest + happy-dom

**Problem:** `navigator.clipboard` is an inherited getter from `Navigator.prototype` in happy-dom. `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(navigator, 'clipboard')` returns `undefined` and `Object.keys(navigator)` returns `[]` (empty). This makes it impossible to spy on `navigator.clipboard.writeText` directly.

**Workaround:** Create a mock navigator in `beforeEach` using `Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(global.navigator))` to preserve prototype chain, then copy own enumerable properties and define `clipboard` as an own property. In individual tests, use direct assignment: `;(global.navigator as any).clipboard = { writeText: mockWriteText }`. Note: spying on `navigator.clipboard.writeText` in Vitest requires `clipboard` to be an own property of the navigator instance, not an inherited getter.

**For share API tests:** `navigator.share` IS an own property of the navigator object in happy-dom, so `vi.fn()` spy + direct assignment works reliably. Use `Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(navigator))` to make a mock that can have its own `share` property.
